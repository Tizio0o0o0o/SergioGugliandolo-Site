# Welcome to my website repository!

In this repository, you will find all the files and documents related to my website: https://sergiogugliandolo.com/. It's a place where I can share my passions and showcase my work. I have created this website with enthusiasm and excitement, and I am looking forward to keep improving it.

I would be thrilled to receive help and suggestions from other developers. However, please keep in mind that I am still learning and I would appreciate it if you could keep the changes simple.

This website is all about learning and showing my projects. I want to create a space where I can experiment and expose new things, and that is where your help comes in. Let's work together to create something amazing!

If you have any questions or want to know more about this repository, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your interest and support!
